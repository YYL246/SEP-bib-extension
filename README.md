==What SEPx can do==
* This extension is for you if you're tired of having to scroll down to SEP's bibliography every time you look up a citation. * Select in-line citations such as "Klein 1999", and SEPx will search for the corresponding bibliography entry and display it in a pop-up window. 
```diff
!KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU SHOULD SELECT ONLY THE LAST AUTHOR'S LAST NAME, A PARENTHESIS, A DATE AND NO MORE.
!e.g. for "Klein(1999)", select "Klein(1999"
!e.g. for "Timothy and Klein (2001)", select "Klein(2001"
```

==Installation==
* Unfortunately it's impossible to install extensions not listed in the Chrome Extension Store, so you'll have to use Developer Mode. Fortunately, it won't take long.  
* Download all the files in this repository and put them into a single folder.
* Open chrome, go to chrome://extensions
* Turn on "Developer Mode" in the top right corner
* On top of the page, click "load unpacked"
* load the folder which holds all the files. 
* Refresh the browswer and enjoy.

==Couple of notes==
* please send bug reports to linyanying03@gmail.com. Please also provide the url and the text you selected.
* I can't promise I'll fix the bug quickly, but I'll try when I have time.

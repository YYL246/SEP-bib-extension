# SEPx
(PLEASE READ THE TEXT IN ORAGE)请务必看橙字！

## What SEPx can do
* This extension is for you if you're tired of having to scroll down to SEP's bibliography every time you look up a citation. 

* Select in-line citations such as "Klein 1999", and SEPx will search for the corresponding bibliography entry and display it in a pop-up window. 
```diff
!KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU SHOULD SELECT ONLY THE LAST AUTHOR'S LAST NAME IF THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE
!e.g. for "Timothy and Klein (2001)", select "Klein(2001"
```

## Installation
* Unfortunately it's impossible to install extensions not listed in the Chrome Extension Store, so you'll have to use Developer Mode. Fortunately, it won't take long.  
* Download the .zip file in this repository and decompress them into a single folder.
* Open chrome, go to chrome://extensions
* Turn on "Developer Mode" in the top right corner
* On top of the page, click "load unpacked"
* load the folder which holds all the files. 
* Refresh the browswer and enjoy.

## Couple of notes
* please send bug reports to linyanying03@gmail.com. Please also provide the url and the text you selected.
* I can't promise I'll fix the bug quickly, but I'll try when I have time.

## SEPx的功能
* 做这个拓展的原因是我很讨厌 SEP 的参考文献没有超链接这一点，这导致每次我要查具体的文献信息都需要划到页面最底下再划上来。
* 安装这个拓展后，只要选择正文中“（Klein 1999）”这样的author-date标记，就会自动跳出窗口显示完整的参考文献信息。
```diff
!由于我才学了JavaScript四天，而且这个主要也是给朋友自用，所以做得不是很精致。具体来说，选择正文中引用标记的时候只选择“最后一位作者的姓”+“年份”+（可能有的）前后括号，别的什么都不要选
!比如 "Timothy and Klein (2001)", select "Klein(2001)"
```
* 暂时只支持以下形式的author-date标记：
  * (Klein 1999)
  * Klein (1999)

# What SEPx can do
* This extension is for you if you're tired of having to scroll down to SEP's bibliography every time you look up a citation. 

* Select in-line citations such as "Klein 1999", and SEPx will search for the corresponding bibliography entry and display it in a pop-up window. 

* !!!If there are more than one author, please only select the last author's name. (e.g. for "Cohen & Kelley (1998)", please select only "Kelley (1998)".

* Currently does not support primary citations (there has to be a date)
